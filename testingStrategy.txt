A big part of our testing strategy was utilizing various test cases. To get our functions working correctly we started out with very general queries and small data sets. After getting a functionality working we would use larger data seta and more extreme cases to try and break the code. An example of where code was modified due to extreme testing is in the searching by date algorithm. Initially this function required a 10-digit datetime but we found that very early dates could have a 9-digit datetime value.

One of the most difficult parts of testing was the fact that to test each part, the earlier parts of the project had to be complete. Because the data preperation algorithms were finished out of order we had no way to test later part of the project that were already drafted.

Another difficult to test part of the project was the time constraints on certain functions. Because the time required for these programs to execute varies based on hardware we had to be careful that all of our timed tests were run on lab machines rather than personal computers. We also Did timed tests on more than one lab machine to enusre that results were consistent.
